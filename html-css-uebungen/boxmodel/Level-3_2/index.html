      <h3>Decorating with plants is simple</h3>
      <article>
        To create the most interesting display, use a mixture of plant sizes
        and leaf shapes. A large plant like Pippa the peace lily, mixed with
        something sculptural like Susie the snake plant and a soft fern like
        Bertie gives an attractive range of textures. Hanging plants, like
        Rapunzel the golden pothos, add interest at different heights. Donâ€™t
        forget your pots. Matching pots will look clean and elegant, while a
        mix of styles and patterns looks eclectic and fun.
