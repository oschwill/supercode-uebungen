        <p>Every idea <img src="./assets/imgs/idea.png" alt=""> starts with a
          need</p>

        <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve
          my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing
          some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell
          phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
          sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)
          made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
          the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

          <h2>Share and show your work</h2>
          <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing
            work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect.
            You will learn to accept feedback and learn from
            it.</p>
